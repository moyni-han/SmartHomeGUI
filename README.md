# An Interactive Smart-Home

## Turning corporate invasion of privacy into a game!




Ignoring the critical title, this application will simulate an environment where a user can 
control the electrical appliances and lights in their fancy smart home. There is a growing user base 
for applications such as these, as we are moving towards a much more connected world. Essentially, anyone
living in a house/apartment with internet connected appliances will be the target audience. I am interested in this project 
because it both seems like a practical project that isn't completely *useless*, so to speak, and because
the project itself can be refactored later on for actual use.


If I had more time to work on the project, one of the things that I would do to refactor the program would be to 
implement the singleton pattern for the house. Inherently, one would only use this application for a singular house
(see the name single), and this would ensure that one doesn't accidentally create duplicates, and ensures that many 
issues do not arise.
